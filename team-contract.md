# Team Work Contract

Our team consists of Ben, Dylan, Kato, and Tommy. All of us are excited about the project, but given the amount of work required, we need to agree on best work practices. That's the purpose of this team work contract: to lay out specifically how we will work together as a team. Below are four sections outlining our goals for the project, how meetings will be conducted, work norms, and how decisions will be made.

## Goals

The main goal of the project is to build a functional, easy-to-use, and aesthetically pleasing dashboard using a dataset of New York plant and animal biodiversity. A sub-goal of the project is to have something all of us can add to our data science portfolios. In other words, we want to be able to confidently present the final product to potential employers.

The main obstacle for the project will be managing the workload with the other courses in the MDS program. In between quizzes and other projects, it will sometimes be difficult to find time for this assignment. That's why it's important the team knows how to work together effectively. We have decided that the easiest way to do this is to delegate work to each other clearly and with full consent from who the work is being delegated to. This will help us ensure the work is distributed fairly and evenly. This process will be explained in more detail in the 'Work Norms' section below.

We expect that the workload on this project will be approximately equal for all team members. We say 'approximately' because we prefer to split up the work rather than have each member repeat it and this will naturally lead to small differences. What we expect to be equal is every team member's level of effort. For example, if one of us finishes a task early, they will offer help on another task.

## Meeting Norms

We've agreed that our primary mode of communication will be in-person. When in-person meetings aren't an option, we will collaborate through Slack, Zoom meetings, or GitHub (including detailed pull requests and commit messages). A regular in-person meeting will be held in the classroom during lab time every Wednesday from 1:30pm to 3:30pm, but we expect more frequent meetings to be scheduled as the workload on the project ramps up. If a group member can't attend one of these meetings, they will let the other members know in advance.

We expect meetings will usually last ~30 minutes, with longer ones occurring later in the project. At the end of every meeting, the team will summarize what was covered and agree on what they will get done before the next deadline or meeting. A message will be sent to our group channel on Slack with these details.

## Work Norms

We expect each team member to contribute approximately 6 hours per week to this project for the first three weeks and then 10 hours per week during the final two weeks.

One of the most important aspects of this project is how we have decided to divide the work. When starting a milestone, we will have a kick-off meeting with the purpose of delegating work to each other. First we will discuss how much work the milestone is in total. After this we will determine how to split the task into different chunks. Finally, we will mutually decide who should work on which chunk, with a particular focus on who we think is best suited for the work. Different team members have different skill sets on this team (for example, some like to write contracts and some prefer to write code) and we want to make sure everyone is comfortable with the work assigned to them. The chunks and who is reponsible for them will be communicated through our group channel on Slack at the end of the meeting.

Once a group member gets delegated a chunk, they are in charge of it. This means they are responsible for finishing it and get final say on any disagreements about its content. Additionally, every chunk will be checked by every other group member. This ensures fresh eyes and different perspectives are available for proofreading all work.

If a team member isn't able to get their work done on time, their teammates will have to pick up the slack. The offending teammate should let his partners know in advance that he won't have the work done on time. It isn't ideal that some team members could potentially do more work than others, but it's necessary to make sure we meet the main goal and sub-goal of the project.

## Decision Making

Sometimes group members will disagree about what to do on a task or how to do it. That's why it's important we have a system for resolving disputes and moving the project forward. Our system for doing this is as described above: when a group member takes on responsibility for a chunk of work, they get final say on what the task will look like, unless they are overruled by all 3 of the other team members. We like this system because it makes for quicker decisions while giving all of us opportunities to practice being in charge.
