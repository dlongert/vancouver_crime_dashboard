# Milestone #2 - Reflection

Our dashboard is off to a good start, but there is still a lot to improve. In this reflection we will cover what is working so far and what we hope to improve for the next milestone. These sections are further divided into the two tabs of our dashboard: temporal analysis of crime and geographic analysis of crime.

## What is Working

On the geographic analysis of crime tab, we have a proper title and the tab is working so we can easily switch between the two pages of our dashboard. We have a basic horizontal bar graph that displays the number of crimes by neighbourhood and a second bar graph that shows the number of crimes by street. Our map of Vancouver is also working.

The filters are also working properly on this tab. When the user selects a neighbourhood or crime type from the dropdown filters, the corresponding graphs update properly.

In the temporal analysis of crime tab, we've crafted interactive charts that shed light on crime trends over time, such as a dynamic chart tracing crime rates through the years. This feature lets users sift through data based on crime type, diving deeper into specific patterns. Another graph lays out crime distribution by season and days, illustrating when crimes are more likely to occur. Together, these tools provide a nuanced view of crime trends, pinpointing spikes.

## What We Want to Add

The biggest addition we want to make to the geographic analysis of crime tab is adding more functionality to the map showing where crimes have occurred. The dataset contains longitude and latitude coordinates, so we are wondering if it is possible to show exact locations of all crimes selected by filters. This is probably the toughest feature in the dashboard to implement, so we will have to experiment with it for the next milestone.

On the temporal analysis of crime tab, we want to change the crimes by day graph to a line graph, which will better show trends as crime changes over time. We also want to add more years to the tab because it is only displaying 2003 right now. This will take some problem-solving because the number of years in the dataset (15) will create clutter.

Lastly, we want to experiment with some aesthetic changes to both tabs. This includes basic changes like font size and colour, but also adding borders to the graphs and potentially more colour. We arenâ€™t sure yet if we will keep these changes, but we want to experiment.
