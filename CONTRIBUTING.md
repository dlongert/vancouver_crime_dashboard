# How to contribute

Welcome to our biodiversity database app! This document explains how you can contribute to this project and provides some guidelines for good behaviour

Here are some links to important resources related to this project:

  * [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/dlongert/dashboard_project/invitations) sets standards for good behaviour within our community,
  * [Dataset description](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/biodiversity-by-county-distribution-of-animals-plants-and-natural-communities) is the source of the dataset used to build this app.

## Submitting changes

Please write clear and concise messages for all of your commits. They don't need to be long messages, but they should include who made the commit, what file(s) the commit was made on, and briefly state what the changes were. Here's a simple example:

    $ git commit -m "Demeter edited the code of conduct to include a section on how to introduce new members of the team."

## Coding conventions

We don't have hardcore standards for submitting code, but we do prioritize readability and clear commenting:

  * Use lots of white space to separate blocks of code. Separate blocks for each step of code.
  * Every block should have a comment that explains what the code does in as few words as possible.
  * Document religiously. Everything should be explained, but make an effort to make any documentation as short (and readable) as possible.

Thanks,
Tommy, Kato, Dylan, and Ben
