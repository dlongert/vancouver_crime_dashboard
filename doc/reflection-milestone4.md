# Milestone #4 - Reflection

Our dashboard is functioning properly and we have implemented most of what we intended to. In this reflection, we will describe the features we successfully added and then reflect on several features we think could improve the dashboard.

## Features We Like

- We successfully added a fully functional heatmap that displays every individual crime reported in our dataset. The map responds properly to a dropdown menu specifying ‘crime type’, is aesthetically pleasing, and has a satisfying zoom feature that allows the user to drill down to specific areas of Vancouver.
- A second feature we are happy with is that we were able to add all years of data to the dashboard. The previous iteration of the project only contained data for a single year, making our crime by year graph effectively useless. This added feature is a huge improvement to the dashboard.
- Lastly, we are pleased with the aesthetic improvements we made to our dashboard since the last milestone. The text is clearer with better formatting, the graphs are larger and easier to read, and the logo for the ‘City of Vancouver’ adds a formal touch to the dashboard.

## Features We Would Like to Improve

There are two features that we would like to see in another iteration of our dashboard. 

- The feature we would most like to improve on is loading time. Currently, there is a slight delay when updating the heatmap with new filter selections and when adjusting the year with the slider in the ‘Number of Crimes by Year’ chart. Although both visuals update properly and are fully functional, the delay is noticeable the more time you spend with the dashboard.
- The second feature we would like to update is the tooltip on the heatmap. Currently, when a user highlights an individual data point on the map, only the longitude and latitude coordinates are displayed. It would be helpful for the user if the tooltip also showed the crime type. We tried to add this feature, but ran out of time while prioritizing other features.
